# Whatapp-scrapper
These scripts process a WhatsApp chat log to analyze messaging patterns within a specified date range. The first script counts the number of messages shorter than three characters sent by each participant. The second script identifies "hattricks," where a participant sends three consecutive single-character messages. The third script combines these functionalities by tracking occurrences, calculating message percentages at different intervals, and identifying three consecutive messages sent by a member. Together, these scripts allow for detailed analysis of messaging behavior, leveraging regular expressions and datetime conversions to extract relevant data from the chat log and perform the specified analyses
